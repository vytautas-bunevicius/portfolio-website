      <div class="main-title">Travel Insurance Prediction: Who's Buying It?</div>
      <div class="body-text">I dug into a dataset from a Tour & Travels Company to figure out which customers are likely
        to grab their travel insurance package—complete with Covid cover. Using 2019 data on about 2,000 customers, I
        built a model to predict who's in and who's out, based on stuff like age, income, and travel habits.</div>

          <div class="subheader-text">What I Did</div><br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Dive:</strong> Loaded up a dataset with customer details—age, job type, income in Euros
              (converted from rupees), family size, and more. Cleaned it up, tossed duplicates, and peeked at patterns
              with charts.</li>
            <li><strong>Stats Check:</strong> Ran some tests (like Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U) to spot what drives
              insurance buys. Income and travel experience stood out big time.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Tested four models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient
              Boosting, and SVM. Tweaked them with random search to boost recall (catching more buyers), then mixed them
              into an ensemble for fun.</li>
            <li><strong>Results:</strong> Random Forest came out on top. Tuned version hit a solid ROC AUC of 0.70, and
              the recall-optimized one nailed 100% recall—catching every buyer, though with some extra noise.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          <div class="subheader-text">How It Played Out</div><br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Prep:</strong> Started with 1,987 records, but 738 were repeats—yep, 37% duplicates.
              Dropped those, leaving 1,249 unique customers. Converted rupees to Euros (1 INR = 0.011 EUR) for a
              European vibe. No missing values, which was nice. Age ranged 25-35, income €3,300-€19,800.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Plotted histograms and bar charts. Age peaked around 28-29 and 32-33;
              income had clumps at €6,600 and €13,200. Most folks were private sector workers, grads, and not big
              flyers. Stats showed income, frequent flying, and overseas trips tied strongly to buying insurance.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Run:</strong> First pass, Gradient Boosting led with 0.76 accuracy, but recall was meh
              (0.49). After tuning for recall, Random Forest shone—hit 100% recall with a 0.70 ROC AUC. The ensemble was
              decent too (0.68 ROC AUC). Trade-off? More false positives to catch everyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Finds:</strong> Income's the star—higher earners buy more. Frequent flyers and globetrotters
              are in too. Age and family size matter a bit, but education and chronic diseases? Not so much.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          <div class="subheader-text">The Details</div><br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Post-cleanup, 1,249 customers. Features like age (mean 29.8), family size (2-9),
              chronic diseases (33% yes), and insurance uptake (39% yes).</li>
            <li><strong>Stats:</strong> Income difference was huge (p < 0.001, CI €11,381-€12,116 for buyers vs.
                €9,100-€9,608 for non-buyers). Frequent flyers (p=0.000009) and abroad travelers (p=10^-26) were way
                more likely to buy.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Specs:</strong> Random Forest won after 50 tuning rounds—max_depth 12, 193 trees, balanced
              weights. Recall-optimized threshold dropped to 0.0188 for 100% recall. Precision took a hit (0.40), but
              that's the cost of not missing anyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Duplicates were a mess—37% is wild. Small sample after cleanup (1,249)
              limited some stats power. Recall focus meant more false positives.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="subheader-text">What's Next</div><br>
          <ul>
            <li>More data would help—1,249's a start, but thin for rare cases.</li>
            <li>Could tweak thresholds based on business goals—fewer false positives if precision matters more.</li>
            <li>Adding features like trip frequency or destination might sharpen it.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="subheader-text">Why It's Cool</div><br>
          This model flags who's likely to buy travel insurance—great for targeting marketing without bugging everyone.
          Random Forest gives a solid balance, or the recall-optimized version catches all potentials if you're okay
          with extra follow-ups. It's not a crystal ball, but it's a handy tool for the company to boost sales smarter.
          Code's on my GitHub if you want a look!
